/*
write a program that can return the frequency of every single character from the string:
   ex:
     str1 = "aabbccaa";
     output: a4b2c2

     HINT:
       easier approach:
          1. remove duplicate ==> st2 = "abc"
          2. then find each of str2 'character' frequancy str1 ==> 4,2,2
          3. result: a4b2c2
  previos section we learned to find the frequency of one character, you will need ro repeat the same step
